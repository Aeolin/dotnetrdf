# Going Deeper

We hope that the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) section has given you all of the basic information you need to use dotNetRDF to write simple utilities, conversions and other RDF processing tools.
However, if you want to use dotNetRDF in more complex scenarios there are a number of additional features that you should be aware of.
This section covers our [exception](exceptions.md) and [event](event_model.md) model, the [utility](utility_methods.md) and [extension](extension_methods.md) methods that the library provides, and two of the more foundational utility classes - the [`NamespaceMapper`](namespace_mapper.md) and the [`NodeFactory`](node_factory.md) in more detail.
