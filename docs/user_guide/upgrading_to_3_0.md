# Upgrading to dotNetRDF 3.0

This page acts as a hub for documentation of the issues and changes you should be prepared to deal with when migrating code written for dotNetRDF 2.x to dotNetRDF 3.x.

Although we aim to provide as much backwards compatibility between releases as possible, the nature of the changes made in dotNetRDF 3.x has meant that in some cases we have had to break our normal [deprecation policy](/developer_guide/deprecation_policy.md).

This section contains the following sections:

  * The [Key Changes](3_0_changelog.md) draws your attention to the main changes in the 3.0 release.
    Some of these are breaking changes that you should be aware of before embarking on code migration.
  * One of the architectural changes we have made is to try to move away from using a lot of global static settings in favour of specifying options more closely to where they are moved (e.g. via constructor injection or method arguments). 
    In line with the deprecation policy, we have (where possible) retained the global static as a way of configuring a global default, but marked the property as deprecated. 
    In a small number of cases this has not been possible and the static property has been removed.
    The [Global Options Changes](global_options_changes.md) goes through the changes made and how to migrate code that makes use of those properties.
