Change Log
----------

This represents a summary of additions, changes and removals for the 0.6.0 release of dotNetRDF

Added
- Core
 - URIs are now interned to reduce memory usage and speed up equality comparisons
 - Improved configurability of HashTable so perfomance can be tailored to usage
- Parsing
 - Support for parsing W3C standard Turtle (allows for more QNames, case insensitive boolean literals and single quoted literals)
 - Registered text/boolean parser for SPARQL Results
- Storage
 - All HTTP based storage now supports HTTP proxying

Changed
- Bug Fixes
 - Fixed a bug with long URIs and SparqlRemoteUpdateEndpoint
 - Critical bug where connecting to an AllegroGraph 4.x repository cleared existing data
 - Fixed a bug whereby Blank Node IDs in NTriples output could be invalid
 - Fixed a bug where QNames in RDF/XML output weren't fully validated against the latest revisions of the XML specs
 - Fixed a bug where Blank Node IDs in RDF/XML output could be invalid
 - Fixed a bug with some queries falsely being considered ASK queries and their results improperly handled for Sesame stores
- Parsing
 - Constructors for BlockingTextReader are now private, use BlockingTextReader.Create() static instead
- Query
 - Major refactor of SPARQL expression evaluation to make it more efficient and maintainable
 - Replaced the Join algorithm with a new algorithm which is significantly faster
 - Improved selectivity of TriplePattern.GetTriples()
 - Some refactoring of ISparqlDataset interface
- Update
 - GenericUpdateProcessor is more intelligent in determining whether a command can be applied to stores that don't have native SPARQL Update support
- Writing
 - Support for outputting W3C standard Turtle (allows for more URIs to be compressed to QNames)
 - WriteThroughHandler periodically flushes the output stream

Removed
- Legacy SQL Store support
- Obsolete BlockingStreamReader class
- Obsolete QueryText method on SparqlParameterizedString
