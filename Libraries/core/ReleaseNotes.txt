-------

dotNetRDF is licensed under the GNU GPL Version 3

Alternatively you may use it under the GNU Lesser GPL Version 3 or under the MIT license

If none of these licenses are suitable for your intended use please contact us to discuss
alternative terms

Usage
-----

To use this library first unzip to a directory on your computer.  Then Add a Reference and use the Browse tab
to find the directory where you unzipped the archive and select dotNetRDF.dll
If you have downloaded the full source for the Project then you can add the Project to your Solution and then 
use Project references instead.

dotNetRDF includes intellisense for all classes providing that the dotNetRDF.XML file is located in the 
same directory as the DLL file.

To use classes from the library it is generally easiest to import the namespaces you need eg.

C#
using VDS.RDF;

VB
Imports VDS.RDF

Requirements
------------

To use this library you will need .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 and you may need to install/have available the 
following third party libraries:
- MySQL Connector.Net 6.0.3 which can be obtained from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/
- JSON.Net 4.0r2 which can be obtained from http://www.codeplex.com/Json
- HtmlAgilityPack 1.4.0 Stable which can be obtained from http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack

The relevant DLLs (HtmlAgilityPack.dll, MySql.Data.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.Net35.dll) are included with
this release and if you wish to use the library you may need to reference these DLLs as well to ensure it is available in your
project for dotNetRDF to use.

If you have downloaded the full source code for the Library you can add a Project Reference to your Solution
instead of referencing the DLL directly.  If you do this Visual Studio should automatically copy the 
relevant DLLs into your output directory if they are required.

If you obtained the library via NuGet then the dependencies will automatically have been included for you

Known Issues
------------

We are aware of the following issues with the library.  Please remember that this is an Beta release and so
there are things that may be buggy still and the API is subject to change at our discretion or based upon
user feedback.
 
Query and Update
- Queries and Updates are not always thread safe - see User Guide for details on how to guarantee this
- The SPARQL CSV/TSV results formats which we support do not currently match the official recommendations, this
  will be addressed in the next release

Storage
- Old SQL Stores are officially deprecated, a new SQL store is available as a separate library dotNetRDF.Data.Sql.dll
- Virtuoso support has been moved into a separate library to reduce dependencies in the core library, existing users
  who use dotNetRDF with Virtuoso must now use dotNetRDF.Data.Virtuoso.dll in addition to the core library
