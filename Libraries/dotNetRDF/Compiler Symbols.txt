dotNetRDF Compiler Symbols
==========================

The dotNetRDF library codebase contains the following compiler symbols, defining these symbols with the define command of your compiler will have the following effects:

Profile Symbols
---------------

These symbols are used to target a specific profile

MONO

Compile for Mono runtime


Feature Symbols
---------------

These symbols are used to disabled various features of the library, these are used in conjunction with a profile symbol to build a specific variant of the dotNetRDF library

NO_ASP

Compile without building the VDS.RDF.Web namespace which provides the ASP.Net integration.  Using NO_WEB will also cause these features to be excluded

NO_DATA

Compile without any System.Data dependency and without any SQL features.  Will exclude Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and Virtuoso support and all classes that dependent on these features.

NO_XSL

Compile without any use of XSL APIs - use in conjunction with profiles like SILVERLIGHT where it is not supported
