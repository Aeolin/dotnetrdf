The dotNetRDF Project is currently exploring moving to Mercurial as our VCS in the near future.

The state of the repository as it is now is a proposed layout and may change before
we switch over for real so please do not rely on this repository for forks for the time being
as we may choose to delete and recreate this repository as necessary.

In the meantime you can find our source code in our SVN repository at
https://dotnetrdf.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dotnetrdf
